# üõ∞Ô∏è Satellite Image Classification with CNNs and Vision Transformers

## üìò Overview
This repository contains a complete series of **nine hands-on labs** completed as part of the  
**IBM AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning** on [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/).  

The project focuses on building, training, and evaluating deep learning models for **agricultural land classification** using **satellite imagery**.  
Both **Keras (TensorFlow)** and **PyTorch** frameworks are used to explore key techniques ‚Äî from **data preprocessing** and **CNNs**, to **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** and **hybrid CNN‚ÄìViT architectures**.
